"lkb2udf","evil_brain","2024-08-28 07:46:46","1","All of the most profitable businesses in Nigeria are majority owned by foreigners. That means that most of the profits get taken out of the country. Nigerians work hard but they're paid slave wages to maximise the amount of money that gets exported to Europe and America.

Mainstream economics is all about maximising profits for private companies. When people talk about growing the economy, they're talking about maximising those profits. Making Nigeria more attractive to foreign investors means allowing them to pay our people less. Allowing them to reduce their business costs by polluting the environment. It means reducing workers rights. That's why wages are so low. That's why there's so little infrastructure. That's why there's shortages of everything our people need to live. Growing food is not as profitable and growing cash crops for export. Building affordable homes, schools and hospitals is not profitable. And when your slaves use up all their energy barely surviving, they're less able to revolt.

Nigeria is a labour colony. Foreign capital is allied with local compradors to enslave our people. And their only goal is to maximise the amount of wealth they can extract. Once you understand that, everything about our economy makes sense.","1f2u1c8","Reasonable_Craft9259","Pt 2 ","2024-08-27 22:21:57","t3_1f2u1c8","4","2","The average Nigerian has 2+ sources of income which shouldn’t be normalized .

"lkangf8","OddlyHetero","2024-08-28 05:04:24","0","I understand your frustration. All of the issues mentioned in this post are economic in nature. 

The macro economic state of Nigeria is completely shit (thanks to the leadership in this country mainly), which makes running a small-mid sized business way less profitable than it should be. This is bad because SMBs should make up most the employers in an economy like Nigeria. 

Because the market conditions suck, it means most SMBs won’t be willing to aggressively expand their team as they should be doing in a developing market like Nigeria. Because of this, almost no one can get formal, salary jobs, and they’re instead forced into multiple informal / gig jobs. 

So in order to improve the market conditions, and give Nigerians more stable employment, the government has to:

1) Eliminate insecurity completely.

2) Give capital punishment to individuals that commit violent / aggravated crimes, as well as to corrupt civil servants (this is the hardest step since it requires a fair, non bigoted justice system, which Nigeria isn’t)

3) Triple the power capacity on the national grid

4) Increase internet user penetration to ~80%

There are so many other things needed in order to change this country, but these are a few of the big ones.","1f2u1c8","Reasonable_Craft9259","Pt 2 ","2024-08-27 22:21:57","t3_1f2u1c8","4","2","The average Nigerian has 2+ sources of income which shouldn’t be normalized .

Education hasn’t been valued much in recent years. Public education, for example, was good when my parents and grandparents went to school, but since then, it’s been a load of nonsense. We really need to fix that. If you look at the curriculum for secondary and tertiary education, you’ll see how outdated it is. The physical conditions of those schools are another issue. If you were an employer, you’d quickly realize that a certificate from a Nigerian university doesn’t really mean someone can do the job, unfortunately.

Over the last decade or so, these institutions have been producing half-baked graduates, so a good number of the working population can’t actually work effectively. I don’t know the exact solution to this, but I do know that throwing unqualified people into the workforce like this is just going to sink the economy.","1f2ty6q","Reasonable_Craft9259","Not a hater just a real question ","2024-08-27 22:18:18","t3_1f2ty6q","14","13","Okay so as Nigerians we know education has been valued heavily for honestly the last 4/5 generations at this point .

"lk859xx","Blooblack","2024-08-27 19:42:39","10","This is a great post.   
  
People underestimate how hard it is to make friends as an adult. If you live far away from your childhood friends, or if they're married / have kids and you're single (or the opposite), you may slowly find your friendship with them being de-prioritised. But then replacing them with new friends is often difficult. If you don't go to a mosque or church, you're not likely to interact with like minds. Even if you do, they may be more - or less - religious than you, and you may not have much in common with them.   
  
If you live abroad and you're the only black or Nigerian person in your team / department / company, you're wary of sharing personal stuff with work colleagues, lest it be used against you at some future date (this has happened to many people, and office politics can get really toxic).  Meanwhile, even white people - let alone Nigerians abroad - complain that socialising in bars and nightclubs is harder these days, because clubs prefer the money they get from private booths, over what the average clubbing attendee pays; meaning there's less and less physical room in clubs to just stand around and chat. As a result, many Nigerians abroad are stuck in their homes after work, and spend too much time online, due to not being able to meet others face to face.   
  
There's a potential epidemic of adult loneliness spreading out there among professionals, and I don't know what the solution is. Maybe people need to bring back the ""house party,"" i.e. start having small get-togethers in one another's homes (for those who live in the same city. Everyone brings a bottle, the host provides cheap, casual food or no food, people meet up, play games, switch off their phones and get to know each other face to face.   
  
Please feel free to disagree with any or all of this; I'm just making a post, not trying to tell anyone what is correct or what is wrong.   
  
Of course, many people are quite content with just having online friends, and this is still good thing, and is better than having no friends at all.

Maybe it's because I'm not very outgoing, but it seems everyone already has their clique. Thankfully I'm quite introverted, so I enjoy solitude. It also helps that I'm friendly with my colleagues at work.

>Maybe people need to bring back the ""house party,"" i.e. start having small get-togethers in one another's homes (for those who live in the same city. Everyone brings a bottle, the host provides cheap, casual food or no food, people meet up, play games, switch off their phones and get to know each other face to face.

The issue with that like the issue with CODM, that the skill gap is pretty large in most games with community. And it's pretty hard to find a game where the community is excited to play with a new player and carry them through that beginning phase. It is just another isolating experience in that way. Unless you really dedicate time into getting into it. And its hard to put in that much time without hearing the Judgement of my mother in my own head. 

Though for the artistic and story telling value, OP should try some cool ""indie games"". ""High on Life"" is a fun and great story if you like animated series and interesting writing.","1f2n6ze","Dancing_Penguin22","Let's friend zone each other 🙃","2024-08-27 17:41:23","t3_1f2n6ze","53","25","Someone made a post about making friends on this app and I'm open to the idea.

"lk6bj3k","azurerain","2024-08-27 13:53:21","1",">Tbf Reggae music & Jamaican artists also sing about fuckery just as much (if not more) as Afrobeats. 

You are very misinformed here. Reggae music is what Jamaicans call ""conscious music"" - it is centred around social or political commentary often with spiritual elements, and is influenced and deeply linked to the religion, Rastafari. So ""getting money"" or vulgar sexual content is the anti-thesis of reggae music, and the genre is known for calling out the ""vanities"" of life. Reggae music is inherently conscious music. You should read up on the the genre and its history. Here's a modern example: [My Child by Mortimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFDj_2U_MTA).

If you're hearing about money, dancing, sex and such, you are referring to dancehall, which is underground/club/pop music popular amongst youth. Two different genres of music with two completely different purposes.

Reggae is the most popular and influential Jamaican genre globally - from Colombia to Germany to Hawaii and its been that way since the 1980s with the exception of the late 90s/early 00s when artists like Shaggy and Sean Paul made dancehall popular on the international stage.

There are Jamaican artists making conscious music, it's just not popular or mainstream at the moment, just like there are Nigerian artists making conscious music but it's not mainstream.","1f2agtx","__african__motvation","Jamaican Singer, Buju Banton has criticised Afrobeats Artistes for not using their music to address societal issues.","2024-08-27 06:38:32","t3_1f2agtx","131","272","Jamaican Singer, Buju Banton has criticised Afrobeats Artistes for not using their music to address societal issues.
