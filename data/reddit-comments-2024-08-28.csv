If you're near universities with well-established African Studies programs or schools (i.e. University of Madison-Wisconsin or U. Chicago in the US but SOAS and U. Birmingham in the UK for example), you can take classes there or approach graduate students to tutor you. I don't think the parental learning route works after a certain age. There's also a digital flashcard program (Yoruba Flashcards?) that advertises on IG and that might be an easier route for you, although I'm skeptical about how effective these types of apps are.

"lkglzby","AfroGorgonzola","2024-08-29 06:02:23","1","The learning effect of apps like Duolingo is massively overstated - not that they don't work at all, but a good old textbook is still miles better IMO. And there are quite a few decent textbooks out there! Here's my unsolicited advice as someone who has learned two foreign languages to a high level and now learning my mother tongue:
&nbsp;

1. Get a few of those zoom calls or a Yoruba-speaking friend to teach you the absolute basics, if you don't know them already. Native speakers are not automatically good at teaching the language, so an actual teacher would be best. 

2. Follow along with a beginner's textbook, ideally one that has audio. A pretty good free option is *Yor√πb√° y√© mi* from the University of Texas. *Colloquial Yor√πb√°* is also quite good and has the best grammar explanations, albeit a bit expensive. The same author also has two older textbooks; *J·∫πÃÅ k'√° s·ªç Yor√πb√°*, which you can find online for free, and the intermediate *J·∫πÃÅ k'√° ka Yor√πb√°*, which I have a physical copy of. There's also *Beginner Yoruba* which is not as well structured but still useful.

3. As you follow the textbooks, make sure to practice speaking out loud - try to copy the audio and get the tones right since that's the toughest part for most people. 

4. Start to consume content appropriate for your level. You won't learn too much if you don't understand at least ~70%, so make sure you find what you can **almost** understand. Lots of popular songs have rather simple Yor√πb√°, and sites like eayoruba.com have content for different levels (free and paid)

5. Get sporadic Yor√πb√° lessons where you can ask questions about what you've been doing in your textbooks, practice speaking, and get corrections. Go into every lesson with a clear goal, e.g. ""today I want to practice forming negative sentences."" The clearer your goals, the more you get from the lesson and the fewer of them you'll need.

6. Use the language IRL - even if it's just greeting someone or asking how things are going, use it every chance you get! Obviously if you have the opportunity to travel to Nigeria, that's the best way to immerse yourself in the language for a few weeks.","1f3nvrz","Bojof12","Why are there so little resources available for learning Yoruba ","2024-08-28 23:29:24","t3_1f3nvrz","13","17","I am a Nigerian-American.

"lkdagqr","Llaauuddrrupp","2024-08-28 17:00:11","8","Nigeria should first separate into two countries imo. It should separate from North East and North West. We are too different in terms of culture and beliefs. The  tribes in North Central and Southern Nigeria are generally more compatible. The North East and North West being extremely religious and conservative, while the Southern and North Central generally being able to allow tradition and modernity coexist at least, to decent extent. So there will be North Nigeria and South Nigeria. In South Nigeria, Hausa-Fulani would only be minority. That way, problems like religious extremism and terrorism can be easier kept in check. Then we should go back to regional system of government with each region divided based mainly on ethnicities or combination of similar minorities and allowed autonomy over their economy. Quota system also removed. Each region should be allowed to develop individually at their own pace and also have their own laws (like tax laws, criminal laws, etc.) and local police force. Military, federal law enforcement,  federal judiciary, etc. of the federal government will exist as usual. So not too different from places like Spain (with it's different autonomous regions with different cultures like Catalonia, Basque country, Galicia, etc.) and USA (with it's different states). We might be one country, but we are still different cultures. We should acknowledge that and co-exist on our own terms instead of trying to make things uncomfortable for everyone. Those that want to do things only their way should be kicked out and allowed to form their own country. This is how it should have been after independence but greed and tribalism took over and blinded leaders from seeing the bigger picture. The moment I truly realized the reason Nigeria can't really work as a whole was when I saw the video of Sir Ahmadu Bello talking about the Igbos.

"lkd6ixx","HorseLongfoot","2024-08-28 16:40:01","7","Renewed emphasis on social discipline and thorough education on a nationalist or regionalist/Africanist identity. My view is that Nigeria's central challenge is the lack of a cohesive identity. That's what leads to lessened corruption and greater investment in long-term infrastructure, growth etc, not the other way around. We're mostly two or three generations removed from village-bound identities, for the most part, and that naturally leads to fission along ethnic and religious lines. A Nigerian ideal that's comparable to an American dream, ""Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite"", or Lee Kwan-Yew-style Singaporean reform (alongside the other ""Asian Tigers"") etc is missing. 

People who dismiss the revival of the old anthem or the concept of renaming the country, rewriting the constitution or redesigning the flag etc don't understand the central importance and uses of these symbols, IMO. Nations are inherently ephemeral ideas--you need broad acceptance of their future, generational promise in order to motivate people to strive for that ideal through war, long-term investment, self-denial and so on. We're trying to build a ""more perfect union"" as a physical project in Nigeria without imagining those ideals and getting people to buy into it as a set of long-term national values and aspirations first. China went from famine and being the ""sick man of Asia"" to ""capitalism with Chinese characteristics"" to the second-largest economy on the planet within the same generational timeframe as Nigeria's independence. It takes that long to become an ""overnight success"" in the real world of policy and governance.","1f3e075","AwarenessLow8648","How would your ideal nigeria be?

Religion: 
All religious beliefs are protected. can't discriminate based on religion/beliefs. In my opinion, all churches and religious institutions are to be registered and taxed. There is an alternative further below.
Furthermore, religious leaders must hold some form of qualification to be as such. Catholics have Rome, orthodox have the EO communion, imams have their religious bodies and must be judged according to how qualified they are in relation to supposed teachings. Any religious body not meeting this metric is not classified as a religious institution and is subject to tax and government oversight. 

Politics: 

all levels of high government must have term limits of two terms of 5 years. Government ministry Offices must be comprised of a ratio of 20:20:20:40, where 20% each is the major tribes and 40% allotted to various minor tribes. This must also be implemented in all political parties. Furthermore, political candidates for each party must be on a cyclical, that is, you can not have a candidate of the same tribe from a previous electoral campaign. My reasoning for this is that tribalism is still an issue that must be addressed. 

All presidential candidates must debate. No, ifs no, buts failure to appear to defend manfiesto policies is automatic disqualification.

Similar to the UK An Office of National Statistics and Fiscal Studies.

Transparent reporting of economic health every quarter. 

Seperation of central bank from Govt hands similar to UK US. Government policy is shaped around central banks' attempts to bring down inflation. They can and should not be subject to government influence, so they can't be forced to print naira, etc.

Military:

I'm ignorant of military structure, but:

Invest in homegrown contractor companies to produce Nigerian made weaponry. 

Assuming this is NOT THE CASE, the military should be split. Three heads of each branch. Army, Navy, Air force. Leaders are rotational on tribe; army leader cannot be Igbo if previous one was Igbo. 

On the point of tribes this does not supercede qualifications by the way this is just to prevent tribalism being the main issue here.

Science: 

Invest in university partnerships to put Nigeria on the world stage research wise. And to bring capital to universities so they fund themselves.

Greetings is conversational, you ought to also respond to the greetings. In Yor√πb√°, we have some basic words we use for greetings like"" ·∫∏ k√∫u, k√∫, ·π£√©, b√°wo, ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ.

Let's analyze them.

1. ·∫∏ K√öU /K√ö. 
""·∫∏ k√∫u"" is used to greet someone older, group of people and sign of respect even while greeting someone's age of group. This is what is used for most of the greetings. We can use ""·∫∏ kaa with"" √†√°r·ªçÃÄ (morning) , ·ªçÃÄs√°n (afternoon) , √†b·ªçÃÄ (return).

Example.
A. ·∫∏ k√∫u i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - Well done.
B. ·∫∏ k√∫u or√≠ire - - - - congratulations.
C. K√∫ ·ªçj·ªçÃÅ m·∫πÃÅta - - - - This is used to greet someone you have not seen in a while.

2. ·π¢√â 
This could mean hope you , have you, will you depending on the content. But in greeting context, it mean ""hope you are""

Example.

1. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a ni--------hope you are fine
Response: d√°ad√°a ni/√†l√†√°f√≠√† ni---I am fine or at peace.
2. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a lo w√† - - - still hope you are fine.
Response :d√°ad√°a n√≠ mo w√†. - - I am fine.

To an older person you would say.
·π¢√© d√°ad√°a l·∫π w√†.

3. B√ÅWO 
This is ""how"" in Yor√πb√° and it is also used for greeting.
Example.

1. B√°wo ni - - - - How are you.
2. B√°wo ni n«πkan - - - How are things.
3. B√°wo ni il√© - - - - - - - - How is family.
4. B√°wo ni i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - How is work.
Response could also range from
D√°ad√°a n√≠, √†l√†√°f√≠√† ni, il√© w√† d√°ad√°a (the family is fine). I·π£·∫πÃÅ ≈Ñ l·ªç d√°ad√°a (work is going fine).

4. ≈É K·ªåÃÅ.
 This could mean ""how is"", how about"" where is"" depending on the context..
Examples.

1. Il√© ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ---------How is the family.
2. I·π£·∫πÃÅ ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ---------How is work.
3. √Äw·ªçn ·ªçm·ªç «πk·ªçÃÅ - - - - - How are the children.
The response could mean the same as above.

Note: The greeting does not have to be specifically with one word, you can mix different words...

For example, we can say : B√°wo ni, ·π£√© d√°ad√°a n√≠, il√© ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ.

"lkcuw1n","Blooblack","2024-08-28 15:39:59","19","If you have really knocked on his door several times, and you believe his conversation is so loud that it reaches a level at which a reasonable person (who lives in your property) would conclude that it was unacceptable, then you should record the conversation from inside your property. That way, if you then go to a different authority, you will be equipped with actual evidence that his conversation is unacceptably loud.

I'm curious about one thing: clearly neither you nor he are landlords; so why have you not contacted the person or organisation from whom you're renting the property?

Talking loudly on the phone is not a criminal offence. I would strongly advise against calling the police. This could get you more trouble than it's worth, because other tenants in that building could take exception to your behaviour and start calling the police on you too, for minor infractions, turning it into a competition of who calls the police more often.

Be dispassionate about this. First record the conversation from your property, then reach out to your landlords or property manager to tell them what is going on, presenting your recorded evidence so it's clear that you're not being malicious. Only if the landlord or property manager fails to do anything should you take it further.

Otherwise, you're opening yourself up to more than you may be able to handle.

As to all these ""Do Nigerians do this"" ""Do Nigerians do that"" questions: Nigeria is composed of over 150 million people from multiple different ethnic groups; there's NO standard Nigerian way to do ANYTHING. Those who have lived in Northern Nigeria and Southern Nigeria and interacted with enough locals can confirm this.

You might as well say ""do all British people drink tea / love Brexit / hate Megan Markle?"" Or ""do all Americans love baseball""?

Just be a dispassionate, grown-up person.

NOTE: If you can hear his phone conversation from a public place - e.g. a corridor - but you can't hear it from inside your own property, then you're not likely to have any case against him, and you're likely to be only seen as a nuisance or as much worse, by not only him but also by anyone else who lives in the same building as you.","1f38ydf","thewonderingcursor","Nigerian neighbour, is so loud.

I've knocked on the door multiple times, he has never come to the door to speak to me directly, but he will immediately cease making loud noises once I knock. But never comes to talk to me. 

The reason I asked if this was a cultural thing, is becuase for me it is clearly very rude to be so inconsiderate and bother your neighbours, especially after they've come to try and talk to you about it. So my thinking was that this is something he has grown up with (talking loudly) and isn't intentionally trying to be rude, it's just been with him for so long that he perhaps forgets he's talking loud. 

I can hear it clear as day in my room with my windows closed. Also, in my country, calling the police will not get him into any serious trouble. They'll just knock on his door and ask him to be quiet, but at least the next time I call them, it might get a bit more serious then. 

This has been going on for months! I haven't spoken to his landlord because that for me is the absolute last resort, I wouldn't want him to lose his accommodation, even though it's a huge inconvenience for me as the owner of my flat.

Firstly, if he won't speak to you in person put a note through the letter box. Explain the situation ask politely if he can keep the noise down after say, 10pm. Explain that if he doesn't you will have to take it further and report him to the council (you could say police even though in reality they won't do anything). It is the council who deal with noise complaints and there is a process to go through (first stage is to try and deal with it yourself). To start with they would ask him to stop. Further stages involve them investigating and ultimately fixed penalty notices, prosecution etc. Keep a diary with times etc. and make recordings - you will need this if it gets to that stage.

Nobody ever asks that question when it comes to other races. Black people are sick and tired of that line of questioning: that's one thing you can be sure of.

You said it's been going on for months? Well, there's no country in the world in which it isn't rude to be inconsiderate to your neighbours for that long. Any fully-grown adult over 18 years old, anywhere in the world, should know that simple fact.

Regardless, if you think that going to the landlord as a last resort, then what makes you think going to the police isn't worse? The police - if they're being nice - will likely tell you to go to the landlord, because this is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.

Or the police will do worse. Much worse.

Like I said, deal with it as you would deal with anybody else. You can always write a note (with a date on it), telling him that you have been enduring this for a long time, and that you are giving him official notification that you will have no option but to report it to his landlord if it continues.

If you've been knocking on his door for a while, because of this, then he already knows that it's you, so there's no need to be anonymous about it, or to worry that he'll find out. He already knows you.

Make two copies of the dated note and give him one copy. That way, your note is written and dated evidence that you warned him in advance. If after that he continues, then you treat it like the civil matter that it is and inform his landlord, with your copy of the dated note and with evidence of your recordings.

I'm concerned that - if this has indeed been going on for months - you have never actually had a face-to-face conversation with him about this. He's that close (physically) of a neighbour, surely you must be able to see him near the house, or in a passage way, or somewhere common to you both, and speak to him face to face. Have you ever had a one-on-one conversation with this man beyond just knocking on his door? If so, what did he actually say to you, in response?

You are not the police, so you can't guarantee how they will respond. If you call the police, and it escalates and becomes violent, you may find that unintended consequences come your way, either via him or via someone else, including observers, neighbours, friends etc.

This is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. The best advice is to keep it that way.","1f38ydf","thewonderingcursor","Nigerian neighbour, is so loud. ","2024-08-28 12:30:29","t3_1f38ydf","97","64","Question to you Nigerians. Is it customary to speak super loudly on the phone?

When he's on the phone at midnight, 1am, 2am, etc calling the police for a noise disturbance is perfectly acceptable, and the police will deal with the matter. They will just ask him to be quiet, nothing more. If they have to return, the worst thing he'll receive is a fine.

That gives you a chain of documented evidence that nobody can deny. If it continues after that, take your copy of the note - along with the recordings you made from inside your apartment - and send them to his landlord.

You need not worry about whether he gets evicted or not; all you care about is that you have warned him with dated notes, which will serve as dispassionate, documented evidence, and that he - as a grown-up - should be aware that there are consequences for bad behaviour.

- *Total Donations Received: N805,180  
- Still Needed:  N1,194,820  

How We‚Äôve Used the Donations So Far:

1. We converted N577,000 to $350 to put in his domiciliary account so he can use his debit card for expenses in Finland.
2. He bought some food items to have something to eat when he first arrives.
3. He also bought some basic medicines in case he gets sick (he‚Äôs actually feeling unwell right now).

New Update: My Brother is Sick with Malaria ü§Æ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On Saturday, we woke up with no money, no food, and no preparations for the flight we had booked earlier this month. Every bit of our savings had already been used. Your donations came at the perfect time, and we are so grateful.

Since Sunday, my brother has been running around, trying to get everything ready for his trip. He‚Äôs barely eaten or slept and has been carrying heavy bags around Lagos, going to markets, and dealing with the endless traffic. He‚Äôs exhausted, but we had to keep preparing.

Yesterday morning, he woke up feeling okay and got ready to go out. But at around 7 am, he suddenly felt cold, dizzy, and weak. My brother rarely gets sick, maybe once every year or two, but today he was hit with malaria, just a day before his flight. He had to wear three shirts and a hoodie just to stay warm and find the energy to go to the bank to exchange naira for dollars.

While at the bank, he got so weak and almost passed out. A kind stranger had to help him get to a pharmacy to buy malaria medicine and an energy drink before he could get some energy. I was terrified‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been so scared throughout this whole process. But thankfully, he‚Äôs starting to feel better now.

He‚Äôs had his first meal of the day yesterday at 10:30 pm. I hope and pray he gains enough strength to handle the stress of the airport and the flight today. I believe everything will work out in the end.

This entire journey has been a rollercoaster, filled with so many ups and downs. We've faced financial struggles, delays in getting his residence permit, and even issues with his permit card getting mixed up and lost with DHL. 

Yesterday's illness is just another hurdle we have to overcome. But with God‚Äôs grace, I‚Äôm confident he will pull through. While we can't predict what tomorrow will bring, our hope is unwavering that things will get better.

I want to thank everyone once again for your donations, support, and kind messages. It means the world to us. My brother‚Äôs journey is just beginning, and we still have some expenses to cover. 

We still need N1,194,820 to pay his first month's rent, due on September 5th, and to ensure he has enough for his personal travel allowance.

If you would still like to help, please send donations to 0128050449, GTBank, Ibrahim.

Before I share the latest news about his journey to Finland and the donations we've received, I want to sincerely thank everyone who supported us. Whether you donated, messaged me privately, or just sent good wishes, we are deeply grateful. This subreddit is full of kind and generous people.

A big thank you also goes to the moderators for letting me share my brother‚Äôs story here and not dismissing us as scammers. Your understanding made a huge difference.

We've been so surprised by how many people found inspiration in my brother‚Äôs story. Many who reached out were impressed by his perseverance and refusal to give up, no matter how hard things got. We believe there are valuable lessons in his experience that can inspire others. 

In the coming days, I will share more about what helped him keep going, even during his darkest moments. He‚Äôs battled severe depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and even suicidal thoughts. Despite all of that, two years ago, he found the strength to start making significant strides toward his educational dream. Now, at the young age of 30 üòâ, he's just starting out his educational journey. 

I‚Äôll be sharing updates about his life and educational experiences in Finland, as well as how he‚Äôs adjusting to a new environment and culture. This community played a crucial role in helping him achieve his goal, so it‚Äôs only right that we celebrate his growth and progress together.

- *Total Donations Received: N805,180  
- Still Needed:  N1,194,820  

How We‚Äôve Used the Donations So Far:

1. We converted N577,000 to $350 to put in his domiciliary account so he can use his debit card for expenses in Finland.
2. He bought some food items to have something to eat when he first arrives.
3. He also bought some basic medicines in case he gets sick (he‚Äôs actually feeling unwell right now).

New Update: My Brother is Sick with Malaria ü§Æ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

On Saturday, we woke up with no money, no food, and no preparations for the flight we had booked earlier this month. Every bit of our savings had already been used. Your donations came at the perfect time, and we are so grateful.

Since Sunday, my brother has been running around, trying to get everything ready for his trip. He‚Äôs barely eaten or slept and has been carrying heavy bags around Lagos, going to markets, and dealing with the endless traffic. He‚Äôs exhausted, but we had to keep preparing.

Yesterday morning, he woke up feeling okay and got ready to go out. But at around 7 am, he suddenly felt cold, dizzy, and weak. My brother rarely gets sick, maybe once every year or two, but today he was hit with malaria, just a day before his flight. He had to wear three shirts and a hoodie just to stay warm and find the energy to go to the bank to exchange naira for dollars.

While at the bank, he got so weak and almost passed out. A kind stranger had to help him get to a pharmacy to buy malaria medicine and an energy drink before he could get some energy. I was terrified‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been so scared throughout this whole process. But thankfully, he‚Äôs starting to feel better now.

He‚Äôs had his first meal of the day yesterday at 10:30 pm. I hope and pray he gains enough strength to handle the stress of the airport and the flight today. I believe everything will work out in the end.

This entire journey has been a rollercoaster, filled with so many ups and downs. We've faced financial struggles, delays in getting his residence permit, and even issues with his permit card getting mixed up and lost with DHL. 

Yesterday's illness is just another hurdle we have to overcome. But with God‚Äôs grace, I‚Äôm confident he will pull through. While we can't predict what tomorrow will bring, our hope is unwavering that things will get better.

I want to thank everyone once again for your donations, support, and kind messages. It means the world to us. My brother‚Äôs journey is just beginning, and we still have some expenses to cover. 

We still need N1,194,820 to pay his first month's rent, due on September 5th, and to ensure he has enough for his personal travel allowance.

If you would still like to help, please send donations to 0128050449, GTBank, Ibrahim.

I was terrified‚ÄîI‚Äôve never been so scared throughout this whole process. But thankfully, he‚Äôs starting to feel better now.

He‚Äôs had his first meal of the day yesterday at 10:30 pm. I hope and pray he gains enough strength to handle the stress of the airport and the flight today. I believe everything will work out in the end.

This entire journey has been a rollercoaster, filled with so many ups and downs. We've faced financial struggles, delays in getting his residence permit, and even issues with his permit card getting mixed up and lost with DHL. 

Yesterday's illness is just another hurdle we have to overcome. But with God‚Äôs grace, I‚Äôm confident he will pull through. While we can't predict what tomorrow will bring, our hope is unwavering that things will get better.

I want to thank everyone once again for your donations, support, and kind messages. It means the world to us. My brother‚Äôs journey is just beginning, and we still have some expenses to cover. 

We still need N1,194,820 to pay his first month's rent, due on September 5th, and to ensure he has enough for his personal travel allowance.

If you would still like to help, please send donations to 0128050449, GTBank, Ibrahim.

Thank you for standing by us. Your support is not just helping my brother; it‚Äôs showing us that there is kindness and hope in the world.","https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f36c32","t5_2qmdl","Nigeria","2008-09-11 15:00:12","116783","en","en","False"
